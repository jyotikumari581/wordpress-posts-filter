We can filter posts based on categories and tags using shortcode. We have used JavaScript, HTML, PHP, and CSS to create responsive blog post filters.
 
## How To Use

 Step 1: Add the code to your theme's functions.php file.


 Step 2. Add the shortcode where you want the blog post filter to appear. **[cat-tag-filter]**
